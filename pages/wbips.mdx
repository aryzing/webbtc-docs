# WBIPs

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  While this document and some proposals are a work-in-progress, it can be used
  in production in agreement with wallets implementing the standard. The
  thinking behind this is to use, test, and iterate on proposals in a real-world
  environment. There should not be a burden of waiting for some ratification
  criteria or 100% consensus.
</Callout>

## Motivation for WBIPs

**tl;dr** Make it easier for developers to build BTC enabled experiences!

- Single interface for BTC and L2s, without the need for new protocols from the ground up for each L2
  - `window.webbtc` as the location for the global interface
  - Use namespaces in method strings to denote L2s (e.g. "lbtc*" for Liquid wrapped, "ln*" for lightning, "stx*" for Stacks)
  - .request API which is future proof, without needing new specs or updates on the provider implementation
  - Standardized JSON API for alternatives communication channels (e.g. WalletConnect)
- Simple and dynamic interface
  - i.e. not static methods, but rather dynamic strings and JSON objects
- Removal of .enable flow of webbtc
  - The .enable flow is a solution to fingerprinting, which would already be harder to do via dynamic methods. So webbtc can keep it for most methods, but .request should not need it
- Reduce overlap/duplication of webbtc and webln \*optional
  - Up for discussion; webln might stay under the current webln namespace (but could re-use the proposals used for WBIP webbtc, e.g. providers API to register wallets)
- Removal of bloat observed in other systems
  - e.g. Ethereum's web3.js (with its reliance on many dependencies to initialize)
  - e.g. Stacks Connect (with its outdated success/error callbacks, unnecessary JWT wrapping and parameters)
- The user (via the wallet interface) should have more control over the actions than the web-app
  - e.g. the user should also be able to choose the network/chain/nonce, not the web-app alone


? No CAIP by default (the less of a burden for the web-app developer, the better). Users should be able to switch/choose network/chain, or Wallet should be able to choose/switch on the users behalf.
TODO: Why not CAIP
WBIPs should be usable without the developer needing to figure out what is in "review/final/etc.". The website should be able to try to use a feature and safely show the end-user a message if the feature doesn't exist yet. The Wallet (which would imply All Wallets) should not need to add something before the users/developers want to use features. This will shift the course of BTC enabled websites into a more democratic / user-driven direction.

## Goals

- Get the community to come together as a working group on single JS API standard
  - Alby
  - Unisat
  - WebBTC
  - Leather
  - Xverse
  - Marketplaces (OpenOrdex, etc.)
- Reduce extisting methods to essentials (for new API styles)
- Add WBIPs solving existing issues users/wallets/applications face
